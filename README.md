## Introduction

This project attempts to address a classic problem of stock prediction using machine learning techniques.

This repository is composed of Jupyter notebooks which outline the steps taken in gathering the data and developing the models used for stock prediction and outcome classification.

The Jupyter notebooks are as follows:

* Data Mining (Phase 1)
* Feature Engineering (Phase 2)
* Model Development & Testing (Phase 3)
